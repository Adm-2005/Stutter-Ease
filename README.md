# Stutter Ease

## About this project
- **What is Stutter Ease?**
  Stutter Ease is a talkbot designed to aid individuals with stuttering challenges. The idea behind it is to create a personalized space for speech practice and self-improvement. The software employs conversational NLP models and other technologies to simulate real-world conversations as accurately as possible.

- **Key Features**
  1. **Personalized Dashboard**
  Stutter Ease's customizable dashboard functions as a primary centre for users, providing them with a variety of tools to improve their speech practice sessions. Users can create and manage profiles with customizable settings. User’s progress is dynamically displayed with the help of metrics such as words per minute (WPM), allowing individuals to track their improvement. 
  2. **Speech Analysis Metrics**
  Stutter Ease employs sophisticated speech analysis metrics to provide users with insightful feedback on their speech patterns. The ‘Words per Minute (WPM)’ metric quantifies speech speed, enabling users to monitor their progress in real-time. 
  3. **Real-time Chat Interface**
  Facilitating natural conversations, the real-time chat interface within Stutter Ease ensures a dynamic and fluid interaction between users and the talkbot. The talkbot adapts contextually to user prompts, fostering a conversation that feels engaging. 
  4. **Voice Recognition**
  Stutter Ease introduces Voice Recognition feature, enabling users to provide input through audio rather than conventional text prompts. The talkbot responds dynamically, recognizing spoken words and generating an apt response.
  5. **Message Encryption**
  In order to ensure confidentiality, Stutter Ease features end-to-end message encryption for all prompts received from users. Before storing any user prompts, the software encrypts the messages, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure.
